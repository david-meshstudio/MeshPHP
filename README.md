# MeshPHP
This project is an extreme light-weight, but easy-to-use PHP framework using JQueryUI as the frontpage UI component library.<br>
It's designed to rapidly construct a backend interfaces for a CMS-like system, by changing and setting several necessary configuration files.<br>
This project is only for the team of MeshStudio at the every beginning and also an experimental project, so we provides no document.<br>
