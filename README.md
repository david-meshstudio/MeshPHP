# MeshPHP
An extreme light-weight, but easy-to-use PHP framework using JQueryUI as the frontpage UI component library.
It's designed to rapidly construct a backend interfaces for a CMS-like system, by changing and setting several necessary configuration files.
This project is only for the team of MeshStudio at the every beginning and also an experimental project, so we provides no document.
